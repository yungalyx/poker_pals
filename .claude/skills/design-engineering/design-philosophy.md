# Design Philosophy

Mindset and principles for interaction design work.

## Core Quotes

### On Quality

> "Let's do it until there's no more that can be done." — Jony Ive, LoveFrom

Quality is a function of time, not wealth of resources or team size. The best things just take time.

### On Craft

> "Craft is one's ability to wield a medium with enough ease, creativity and purpose to make things that: are distinctive and recognizable, have excellent ergonomics, enjoy universal appeal, feel both original and elemental, carry a spirit you connect with, stand the test of time."

### On Utility

> "People aren't trying to use computers—they're trying to get their jobs done." — Apple HIG (1987)

Utilitarian is a virtue, not a flaw.

### On Details

> "Every single interface has infinite opportunity for polish and delight. Animate those icons. Brand that scrollbar. Polish that :active state. Load a single typeface glyph to render the world's best ampersand. Make it fast. Make it accessible." — Paco Coursey

## Principles

### Good Taste = Seeing Further

Seeing that there is more to be done is the definition of good taste. People with good taste can see further down the iteration lifecycle.

### Small Teams Ship Quality

Small teams with autonomous high-performers usually produce the highest quality output. Easier to find 5 people aligned on taste and skill than 50.

Solo projects can be highest quality because one person remembers every hack or dirty corner that needs cleaning.

### Articulating Intuition

The bar for giving design feedback is low because it's visual. You wouldn't give vague technical feedback to an engineer without being able to engineer yourself.

But the bar for responding is unproportionally high. "Why is this layout in two columns?" won't be satisfied with "because it felt right."

**Don't doubt your intuition—it's probably right, you just can't put a finger on it yet.**

### Details are Care

Details communicate care. Every interaction is an opportunity to show you gave a damn.

### Working With the Material

Code is your material. Like testing wood vs concrete for a chair, code introduces constraints that shape ideas:

- Framework limitations become design constraints
- Native behaviors become interaction patterns
- Performance characteristics shape animations

**Constraints don't just ground ideas—they shape them.**

### Happy Accidents

Through building (not approximating) you discover happy accidents that influence design direction. Ideas prototyped for one project become scaffolding for future work.

### Validation Through Exhaustion

Build and build until nothing left to explore. Then try even the "dialed to 100" stupid ideas. Often you'll go back 10 iterations and realize "the simple one feels way better."

## Anti-Patterns

### "Delight" as North Star

> Delight as a north star can misguide us to build vehicles for virality that confuse people into thinking design is just how something looks.

Focus on usability AND aesthetics, not "delight."

### Novelty for Novelty's Sake

> "There's this novelty tax when you try a new product... People just couldn't handle how much there was to learn that was new." — Josh Miller

Don't add novelty to consumer products when users' "most visited sites" aren't design tools.

### Lipstick on a Pig

If your interaction works 80% of the time but fails 20%, the perception of quality is shattered. The bar for core interactions is so high there's no room for "it kinda works."

**If a complementary detail can't be done reliably, it should not be done at all.**

## Design Context

### People Want to Learn (Sometimes)

> "People are instinctively curious: they want to learn, and they learn best by active self-directed exploration." — Apple HIG

Not all interfaces need to be homogeneous. In the right context, people are excited to learn powerful novel tools:

- iOS gestures replacing Home Button → loved
- Power users choosing Raycast over Spotlight → earned complexity
- Design tools for designers → expected learning curve

### But Most People Have Jobs

Most users just want to get stuff done. Reserve creative expression for:

- Side projects / portfolios
- Design-savvy audiences
- Moments of magnitude (achievements, milestones)

## The Friction of the World

> "Despite our many advancements to do more with less, how do we spend our time saved? We bake bread. Build furniture. Play vinyl. Shoot on film. We choose to do some things the hard way because living is feeling the friction of the world around us." — Andy Allen

We will not stop designing interfaces because they are another medium of expression from humans to humans.
